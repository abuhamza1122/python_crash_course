# DEMO:
# def double(x):
#     return x*2
# print(double(5))
# this method is easy,but what about lambda function?we will see
double = lambda x : x*3
cube = lambda x : x**3
avg = lambda x,y: (x+y)/2
print(double(5))   #  hence this method is easy, and readible
print(cube(5))
print(avg(2,2))
# lambda functions are annonymous function(has no name)
